achiving: Combines multiple files into one, which eliminates the overhead in individual files and makes the files easier to transmit.

The tar command has three modes that are helpful to become familiar with:

Create: Make a new archive out of a series of files.
Extract: Pull one or more files out of an archive.
List: Show the contents of the archive without extracting.

tar -c [-f ARCHIVE] [option] [file...]
