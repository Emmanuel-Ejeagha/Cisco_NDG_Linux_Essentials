Standard error or STDERR, is error messages generated by commands.

ls /text.txt
ls: cannot access /text.txt: No such file or directory

ls /text.txt > error
ls: cannot access /text.txt: No such file or directory

In the given instance, the output displayed was directed to the file named "output.txt" instead of being shown in the terminal. Therefore, the displayed output cannot originate from STDOUT, as it would have been redirected to the "output.txt" file. Since all command output is directed to either STDOUT or STDERR, the presented output is inferred to be STDERR.


ls /text.txt 22> error
