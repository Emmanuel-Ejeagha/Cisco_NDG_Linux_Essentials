The setuid permission is set on an executable binary file (a program) the binary file is run as the owner of the file, not as the user who executed it. 


example:
ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 68208 Feb  6 12:49 /usr/bin/passwd

To add the setuid permission symbolically, run:
chmod u+s file


To add the setuid permission numerically, add 4000 to the file's existing permissions
chmod u+s file

To remove the setuid permission numerically:
chmod 0775 file


To remove the setuid permission symbolically:
chmod u-s file
